 Features
  * add, edit, move, copy, paste and remove frames, change their timing; modify them in your own favorite external image editor and then save changes back to the animated cursor in some clicks.
  * Reverse order of frames in one click.
  * Perform operations and transformations on frames: horizontal and vertical flips, left and right rotations, custom rotations, image merging.
  * add mouse pointers to existing images in some clicks thanks to the image merging feature.
  * AniTuner handles all color reductions and resize operations itself, while taking care of transparency or alpha channels.
  * AniTuner can correctly draw 32-bit animated cursors even if your Windows version doesn't support it.
  * AniTuner shows live animated cursors while editing: any change is immediately visible.
  * Test animated cursors by replacing the default mouse pointer during a short delay with your edited cursor.
  * Edit the title and author of the animated cursor (art information).
  * Modify the hotspot of the animated cursor.
  * Drag and drop support for animated cursors and frames.
  * AniTuner always optimizes animated cursors when saving them (identical frames will be saved only once).
